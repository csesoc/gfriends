At the beginning of each session, go into the file "lab_outlook.pl"
and change the "$session" variable to the new session. This is
so that the proper lab bookings for classes can be looked up from
'give's records.


----------------------------------------------------------
Now that we're going off the Rectangles data, at the start
of every session run this command in the TooheysExtraDry
directory:

wget http://rectangles.srvr.cse.unsw.edu.au/cgi-bin/labs/labusage.php ; mv labusage.php mjc.txt
