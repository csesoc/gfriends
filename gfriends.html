<h1>Graphical Friends (gfriends) Help File</h1>
[By scos506 and ijgo605]<br>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ffc800"><tr><td>To run Graphical Friends type <b><u>~stevec/gfriends</u></b> on any CSE machine or login server.</td></tr></table>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#00ff00"><tr><td>A great thing to save you time would be to put this line in your ~/.bashrc file: <br>
<b>alias gfriends='~stevec/gfriends'</b><br>
Or type this in your ~/bin folder: <br>
<b>ln -s /home/stevec/gfriends</b><br>
That way you need only type <b>gfriends</b> into a terminal to run it.
</td></tr></table>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Friends list format</b></u></td></tr></table>

You friends list is located in your home directory as "<b>~/.friends</b>".
Normally friends files should have lines that look like this:

<table border="1"><tr><td>name = &lt;username&gt;, &lt;real name&gt;</td></tr></table>

gfriends is the same.

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Custom Groups/Colours of people in gfriends</b></u> (adapted from ijgo605's fork)</td></tr></table>

In gfriends, your friends always come up as green and random people as blue.

You can define your own custom groups (and colours to match) in your ~/.friends
file. This addition outlined below won't effect the running of normal 'friends'
as 'friends' just ignores anything it doesn't like.

To put people into a custom group just put the following line before the group
of people.

<table border="1"><tr><td>group:&lt;group name&gt;:&lt;R&gt;,&lt;G&gt;,&lt;B&gt;</td></tr></table>

where &lt;group name&gt; is the name of the group you want to show up in
                         the side bar of gfriends
  and &lt;R&gt;,&lt;G&gt;,&lt;B&gt; is the RGB colour value you would like to
                         make this group of people.

For example, here is someone's short ~/.friends file.

<table border="1">
<tr><td>
name = stevec,  Steve<br>
name = ijgo605, Ian<br>
name = wyos,    Yose<br>
name = glenk,   Glen<br>
group:CSEsoc Exec:255,255,0<br>
name = cmac,    Chris (VP)<br>
name = ramanak, Ramana (Tech)<br>
group:Students:0,255,255<br>
name = davidc,  David<br>
name = cpu,     char*
</td></tr>
</table>

So when this file is loaded up in gfriends, the people at the top of the file (stevec,
ijgo605, wyos, glenk) will come out the normal green colour and be in the group 'friends'
as normal. Those under the 'CSEsoc Exec' heading will be coloured yellow (RGB:255,255,0)
and those under the 'Students' heading will be coloured cyan (RGB:0,255,255).

Notice that the first few names are automatically put in the friends (green) group as
usual. When gfriends runs it automatically pretends this line ("group:friends:0,255,0") 
is the first line in your ~/.friends file so that everyone from the start of the file is 
assumed to be in the 'friends' group.

Note: to make gfriends efficient, i don't do any error checking when reading in custom group
formatting lines. If you can't type properly then you miss out. (For those unsure about what 
could go wrong this can include putting a colon ':' character in the group name, or putting
a value for either R,G or B that is outside the 0-255 (inclusive) range.)

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Custom username colours</b></u> (adapted from scos506's etstats program) </td></tr></table>

You can specify a friend's nick name to appear in any colour format. It works the exact same way
as coloured player names in Quake3/ET. As with Quake/ET naming, a '^' character followed by 
a keyboard character will change to colour of the text from that point onwards.

Simply put these colour mod characters into the nickname part of the person in your .friends file,
for example below:

<table border="1">
<tr><td>
name = stevec, ^1[5kz]^4SC <br>
name = cmac, ^1[5kz]^fcmac
</td></tr>
</table>

These names would be displayed in gfriends as:
<font color="#ff0000">[5kz]</font><font color="#0000ff">SC</font>
<font color="#ff0000">[5kz]</font><font color="#3399cc">cmac</font>

<u>Note</u>: This will override any custom colours you have assigned to the person's
group (if you are using custom group colours)

<u>Note</u>: The colour mod characters will obviously look wierd under a text based 
friends script. 

<u>Some common Q3/ET colour modifiers</u>

Mod  RGB          Colour
 ^0    0,  0,  0  <font color="#020202">black</font>
 ^1  255,  0,  0  <font color="#ff0000">red</font>
 ^2    0,255,  0  <font color="#00ff00">green</font>
 ^3  255,255,  0  <font color="#ffff00">yellow</font>
 ^4    0,  0,255  <font color="#0000ff">blue</font>
 ^5    0,255,255  <font color="#00ffff">cyan</font>
 ^6  255,  0,255  <font color="#ff00ff">purple</font>
 ^7  255,255,255  <font color="#ffffff">white</font> (white)
 ^8  238,119,  1  <font color="#ee7701">orange</font>
 ^9  127,127,127  <font color="#7f7f7f">grey</font>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Checking printer queues</b></u> (adapted from ijgo605's fork)</td></tr></table>

Move your mouse over a printer to see the length of the queue. Click on a printer to run
'lpq' on the printer to see a complete queue for the printer.

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Checking someone's details</b></u> (adapted from ijgo605's fork)</td></tr></table>

Click a person to see their name and classes they are in.

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Person Options</b></u> (from scos506's fork)</td></tr></table>

If you right click on a person, a menu appears with options of what you can do with that
person's details.

At the moment there are four options:

 "Add to friends list": brings up an input window to enter the person's nickname, then
                        appends an appropriate line to your ~/.friends file
                        (Note: this just appends the line to the end of your ~/.friends file.
                         If you have custom groups set up you will have to move the line into
                         the appropriate group yourself. Why do you have to move it yourself...
			 because at the moment i cbf making something to do it)

 "talk &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;": opens an xterm running the talk command, so you
                                 can talk to the person.

 "pp &lt;user&gt;": opens an xterm displaying the complete 'pp'/'acc' details of the given person.

 "qstat &lt;host&gt;": opens an xterm displaying the details of a Quake 3 server if one is running
                 on that host.
<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Toggle Random's IDs</b></u> (from scos506's fork)</td></tr></table>

You can toggle whether or not to show random (blue) people's IDs on the screen. In the
sidebar simply click [show ids] to toggle the IDs on or off.

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Refreshing the labs</b></u> (from scos506's fork)</td></tr></table>

gfriends doesn't auto update itself (for reasons related to keeping SS happy).

You can rescan the labs to update the display by clicking on the "Rescan Labs" button
in the top right corner of the window. The button should change its label to "Scanning...",
before returning to "Rescan Labs" when the scan has finished.

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Checking if a lab will be booked later</b></u> (ijgo605's idea implemented by scos506) (data is now sourced from the Rectangles Project database)</td></tr></table>

Hate opening up some work ready to go, or Quake, only to be logged out by a class 10mins later?

If you click on the name of the lab in gfriends it will display all the times the 
lab is booked out for classes (or other events) for the whole day.

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Having scroll bars for people with low resolution screens (esp. laptops/notebooks)</b></u> (from scos506's fork)</td></tr></table>

If your screen resolution is too small to display the complete normal sized gfriends window,
the gfriends includes some scroll bars for you to navigate the lab map.

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Zoom into a Lab</b></u> (from scos506's fork)</td></tr></table>

If you click on the zoom icon to the left of the lab name (the 4 directional arrow) you will
be able to see a zoomed in view of the lab. To close this zoomed in window, click the 'X' 
on the top right corner of the zoomed in lab. This is useful for tutors.

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Tutor Options - Add lab to friends list</b></u> (inspired by a CSESoc meeting)</td></tr></table>

When zoomed into a lab, you can select to append the whole lab to your ~/.friends list
under the title "Students". This is useful for the first lab when all your students
actually turn up. 

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Tutor Options - Gen PDF cheat sheet</b></u> (inspired by a CSESoc meeting)</td></tr></table>

When zoomed into a lab, you can generate a PDF cheat sheet of everyone's name in the lab.
Most tutor's are friendly, but they have trouble remembering people's names in the
first few weeks. Generate the PDF sheet, print it out and hide it under your marking
sheet to peek at.

<table border="0" bgcolor="#ddddff" width="100%">
<tr><td><u><b>Username Alias Updater</b></u> (robertm's idea implemented by stevec)</td></tr></table>

If you're one of the cool people in CSE you and your friends will gradually get custom
logins. When your friends' logins change you used to have to update them in your ~/.friends
file so you can still find them. Now Graphical Friends does the update for you. It checks
if any of your friends have newer logins than appear in your ~/.friends file and inserts
a new line for you.

<tr><td><u><b>Coming soon...</b></u></td></tr></table>

Suggestions in production:
<ul>
<li>Scan the labs for Q3/ET/Trem servers, displayed on an icon overlay</li>
</ul>

Suggestions not in production, but may be implemented in the long term:
<ul>
<li>Monitoring the location of Loc (Help Desk guy) so we know when he's coming to catch us eating or drinking in the labs</li>
<li>3-D OpenGL version (called glfriends?) (Bad things about this: people use gfriends of the CSE servers with no OpenGL; loading time)</li>
</ul>

Any suggestions for more features, just mail Steve.
